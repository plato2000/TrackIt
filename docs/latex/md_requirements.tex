\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The solution shall handle multiple simultaneous G\+PS tracked packages sending updates.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by using {\ttfamily \hyperlink{package__events_8py}{package\+\_\+events.\+py}} (a program we created -\/ see documentation) to simulate multiple G\+PS tracked packages sending updates and used the client to view the packages updating in real time.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be easily accessible from a Windows 7 computer.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement through the use of Bootstrap 3 on a web app client to make it easy to access through Internet Explorer 8, the default web browser for a stock Windows 7 computer.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall support an admin mode that shows all package location updates on a map.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by using the admin mode we built in to the client, and clicking the button to give the admin the option to add all packages to the tracked list.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall support a user mode that shows a subset of package location updates on a map.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by inputting test package U\+U\+I\+Ds into the field on the web app client and displaying the packages’ current locations and the paths they have taken, as well as watching the locations change as they update on the map.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall accept a list of U\+U\+I\+Ds in user mode to control the subset of package location updates displayed on the map.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by inputting test U\+U\+I\+Ds into the field on the web app client and watching as the appropriate packages showed up in the table below.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall accept name, destination, and G\+PS unit U\+U\+ID information as H\+T\+TP query parameters on a H\+T\+TP G\+ET of the U\+RL path {\ttfamily /tracknewpackage}. An example follows\+: {\ttfamily G\+ET \href{http://127.0.0.1:8080/tracknewpackage?name=Some+Name+Here&destinationLat=42.4877185&destinationLon=-71.8249125&uuid=b0f9bb21-160f-4089-ad1c-56ae8b2d5c93}{\tt http\+://127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:8080/tracknewpackage?name=\+Some+\+Name+\+Here\&destination\+Lat=42.\+4877185\&destination\+Lon=-\/71.\+8249125\&uuid=b0f9bb21-\/160f-\/4089-\/ad1c-\/56ae8b2d5c93}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by using the provided {\ttfamily Package\+Events\+Simulator.\+groovy} file to send these messages to the server on our solution and then watching them show up in our My\+S\+QL database.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall respond with a J\+S\+ON encoded body which includes the registered uuid on an H\+T\+TP G\+ET of the U\+RL path {\ttfamily /tracknewpackage}. An example follows\+: {\ttfamily G\+ET Response Body\+: \{ \char`\"{}ack\+U\+U\+I\+D\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}\mbox{[}b0f9bb21-\/160f-\/4089-\/ad1c-\/56ae8b2d5c93\mbox{]}\char`\"{} \}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by entering a sample H\+T\+TP G\+ET request through Postman R\+E\+ST client and saw the correct response show up.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall accept a J\+S\+ON encoded body which includes location, elevation, and time on a H\+T\+TP P\+O\+ST to the U\+RL path {\ttfamily /packagetrackupdate/}. An example follows\+: {\ttfamily P\+O\+ST \href{http://127.0.0.1:8080/packagetrackupdate/b0f9bb21-160f-4089-ad1c-56ae8b2d5c93}{\tt http\+://127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:8080/packagetrackupdate/b0f9bb21-\/160f-\/4089-\/ad1c-\/56ae8b2d5c93}} {\ttfamily P\+O\+ST Body\+: \{\char`\"{}lat\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}42.\+4879714\char`\"{},\char`\"{}lon\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}-\/71.\+8250924\char`\"{},\char`\"{}ele\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}195.\+9\char`\"{},\char`\"{}time\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}2015-\/12-\/08\+T08\+:42\+:33.\+188-\/05\+:00\char`\"{}\}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by running the {\ttfamily Package\+Events\+Simulator.\+groovy} with the .gpx files and having the server receive updates for the packages while viewing the updates.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall accept a J\+S\+ON encoded body which includes a delivered flag on a H\+T\+TP P\+O\+ST to the U\+RL path {\ttfamily /packagetrackupdate/}. An example follows\+: {\ttfamily P\+O\+ST \href{http://127.0.0.1:8080/packagetrackupdate/b0f9bb21-160f-4089-ad1c-56ae8b2d5c93}{\tt http\+://127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:8080/packagetrackupdate/b0f9bb21-\/160f-\/4089-\/ad1c-\/56ae8b2d5c93}} {\ttfamily P\+O\+ST Body\+: \{\char`\"{}delivered\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}true\char`\"{}\}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by waiting for packages to be marked as delivered by the {\ttfamily Package\+Events\+Simulator.\+groovy} script, and seeing that the package was marked as delivered in the My\+S\+QL database in response.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall calculate and display distance to destination.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by clicking on the dropdown menu and seeing that each package displayed its distance to the destination.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall calculate and display estimated arrival time.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this requirement by looking at the table to see that each package showed its estimated arrival time.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Additional Requirements (By Us)\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The solution shall be able to display a selection of packages on a map.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this feature by selecting some of the packages on the table on the client to be displayed on the map.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be able to display a human-\/readable location for the starting point, current location, and destination of the package.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this feature by selecting a package and observing that the information showed up.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be able to recover its data in the event of a server shutdown.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this feature by starting to track a number of packages, restarting the server, and seeing that the previously selected packages loaded once more.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be able to maintain a database of package positions for all packages ever tracked by the system.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this feature by having a “\+Select all delivered” button for admin mode that showed all packages that were stored in the database if they were delivered and a similar button for undelivered packages and when both are selected, all packages ever stored are displayed.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be accessible easily from a mobile phone or a tablet.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We tested this feature by changing the user agent and size of the screen in Chrome Developer Options and seeing that everything responded as expected.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be modular enough to allow for future extension on accessibility.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We know this works because a C\+SS file has the ability to change the colors and the browser zoom increases font sizes and colors across the whole webpage.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The solution shall be modular enough to allow for future extension on security.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We know this works because we already have a My\+S\+QL database for storing package updates, and adding another table for usernames and passwords would be fairly easy. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
